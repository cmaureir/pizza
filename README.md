## Bring your C++ Project to Python land

Exposing C/C++ project to Python is the main idea behind all the blazing
fast and modern Python modules we currently have, but starting a new
module only using CPython could be challenging.

There are many tools out there that can help you on this process,
so we will try to briefly mention them, but most importantly
you will learn about Qt's secret weapon to unleash the features of the
most powerful C++ UI framework in Python, Shiboken.

After this talk you will have no excuse to provide Python bindings
for your favorite C/C++ project.
